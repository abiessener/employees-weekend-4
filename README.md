# MEAN Stack Employee List (CRUD)
Hey look, Angular! Figuring out Angular was one of my larger challenges in learning full-stack development, probably because jQuery made so much intuitive sense to me (select a DOM element, then do something to it - perfect!). But man, AngularJS saves you so much trouble.

## What I Learned
Angular, obviously. This was also my first whack at Bootstrap, and I'm so glad I took the time to start learning it. CSS can be an infinite rabbit-hole, especially when you're still figuring out the basics, and the ability to quickly get something that looks decent together is still a massive improvement to my workflow.

I'm pretty proud of the edit functionality here as well. That was some blue-sky experimentation on my part compared to what we learned in class, and it turned out pretty well.

Finally, this was the first project I really made myself stick to a more structured approach in how I implemented it and in what order. That was huge. The benefits were immediately apparent; I got this done much faster than I would have otherwise and with less stress.

## Applicability
I could see using the edit functionality as a base for something in a production app. Other than that, probably not.
